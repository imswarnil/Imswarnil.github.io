# Adsense Demo

Google AdSense is a program run by Google through which website publishers in the Google Network of content sites serve
text, images, video, or interactive media advertisements that are targeted to the site content and audience. These
advertisements are administered, sorted, and maintained by Google. They can generate revenue on either a per-click or
per-impression basis.

## Ad Placement Examples

#### Multiplex Ad

## Suggested Ad Placements

- **Sidebar**: Ideal for Square and Skyscraper ads. These are visible alongside the main content and are great for
attracting attention without interrupting the user experience. - **Header**: Top Leaderboard ads work well here as they
are the first thing visitors see when they load your page. - **Content**: Article and Multiplex ads can be placed within
or between content sections to integrate seamlessly with your pageâ€™s flow. - **Footer**: Small Leaderboard ads are less
intrusive and fit well at the bottom of your page, ensuring visibility as users scroll down.

Feel free to adjust the placements as needed based on your website's design and user behavior.
